Generative AI can be categorized into two main types:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: GANs consist of two neural networks that work together to generate new content. One network generates content, while the other network evaluates the generated content and provides feedback to the first network. GANs work by minimizing the difference between the generated content and the real content, using a loss function such as the binary cross-entropy loss.\n",
            "*   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: VAEs are neural networks that learn to compress and reconstruct data. They can be used to generate new content by sampling from the compressed representation. VAEs work by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed data and the original data, using a loss function such as the mean squared error.\n",
